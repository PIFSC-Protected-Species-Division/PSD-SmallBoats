    "text": "“The name Papahānaumokuākea commemorates the union of two Hawaiian ancestors – Papahānaumoku and Wākea – who gave rise to the Hawaiian Archipelago, the taro plant, and the Hawaiian people.\nPapahānaumokuākea is of great importance to Native Hawaiians, with significant cultural sites found on the islands of Nihoa and Mokumanamana, both of which are on the National and State Register for Historic Places. Mokumanamana has the highest density of sacred sites in the Hawaiian Archipelago and has spiritual significance in Hawaiian cosmology.\nThe Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were explored, colonized, and in some cases permanently settled by Native Hawaiians in pre-contact times. Nihoa and Mokumanamana, the islands that are closest to the Main Hawaiian Islands, have archaeological sites including agricultural, religious, and habitation features. Based on radiocarbon data, it’s been estimated that Nihoa and Mokumanamana could have been inhabited from 1000 A.D. to 1700 A. D. These islands pose the same dilemma as a score of other islands in Oceania, which were small targets for voyaging and often at some distance from their nearest occupied neighbor. All of these islands were either empty at contact or abandoned, having been occupied some time previously. Due to the environmental constraints of being small, geographically isolated, and not having enough resources to allow self-sustainability, demographic stability (in initial and later stages of colonization) have been thought to be the main reasons why interaction was so vital to these regions.”\n\nFrom Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument webpage",

PSD is comprised of the Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP), Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program (HMSRP), Cetacean Research Program (CRP), and PSD Services and Support Program (PSSP).\nThe Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (CIMAR), funded by the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH), promotes the delivery of cutting-edge research to support NOAA’s missions and programs. CIMAR serves as a bridge between the basic and applied research capabilities of the University of Hawaiʻi (UH) and the mission-oriented research of NOAA.\nSee Acronyms for more.",

It is an observational process documenting natural changes over time, identifies dominant cycles within certain species or occurrences (flowering, fruiting, presence/absence of flora/fauna, cloud formations, spawning, or recruiting of fish species, etc.) and assists in identifying correlations between species and/or occurrences as indicators of the other. When one thing happens (a flower species blooms en masse), it indicates that another occurrence (a fish is spawning en masse) is happening. It allows natural cycles to support and guide our management practices, allowing the flexibility needed to ensure the best times to rest areas or species from cultivation and harvest—or vice versa. Huli ’ia stems from traditional management systems driven by an intimate understanding of the natural environment and the ability of communities to adjust and adapt their activities as best management practices to support these systems of nature.”\n\nFrom Huli’ia: Every Place Has A Story.

At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select ‘commit’. Once the commit goes through– select ‘Push to Origin’ at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.\nOpen your Github repository and check out the changes on your README at the bottom of the page!\nAdopt this process as your daily habit of working on your projects locally and saving your data to Github.\n\nFor more information, see:\nIntroduction to Git/Github Tutorial (Eli Holmes, NMFS)\nGit for Humans (Alice Bartlett)\nHappy Git with R (Jenny Bryan)"

    "text": "Modify Existing Content\nHere are basic instructions for modifying existing content, such as the example pages provided in the PAM Template Lab Manual: 1) Ensure that you have cloned the Github Repository using Github Desktop, and that you have created an RStudio project, following directions outlined here.\n\nOpen your RStudio project (here we will assume it is a clone of the PAM Template Lab Manual), and navigate to the ‘content’ folder (lower right hand side of RStudio, Files Tab). As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."

    "text": "This is a template for a simple Quarto website (type: website). It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory. \nAllow GitHub Actions under Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General \nAllow GitHub Actions to write to the gh-pages branch. Scroll to the bottom under Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General, and make sure “Read and Write” is selected. \nEdit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the Settings &gt; Pages page to find the url to the Quarto website\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the qmd or md files in the content folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).\nAdd the files to _quarto.yml\n\n\n\n\nThe most common trouble users run into is that the book is not rendering. Check the following:\n\nThe gh-pages branch does not exist. If you forgot to check the check box to include all the branches when you created the repo from the template then it won’t exist. The Action will fail if the gh-pages branch does not already exist. You can create the branch and then push a change to main to trigger the Action to run again.\nThe GitHub Pages has not been set.
