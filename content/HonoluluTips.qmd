## Traveling to Honolulu
Book flights to  Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL). The Bus and rideshare pickups are available outside the terminals.


## Living in Honolulu
Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are typically the easiest sources to find short-term rentals on island.

**Recommended parts of town??

## Transportation

Ford Island shuttle service: The shuttle is a white van with a NOAA logo. It runs consistently from 6:00-9:00 a.m. and from 2:30-600 p.m. You can also schedule a ride in between those hours by calling 808-725-6229.

Shuttle tips from Jon - The stops are not obviously marked, but the one I use most is on Kamehameha Hwy heading eastbound. Between bus stop #695 and the right turn onto the Ford Island bridge, there is a yellow fire extinguisher just past where the right turn lane begins.

It is recommended that you call the shuttle service number when you arrive at the stop, even if it is during their normal running hours.

The Bus provides service across Oahu and is the cheapest way to get around the island.

If you choose to ship a car from the mainland to Oahu, prices typically range around $1500.

## Kuleana Campaign
The Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) and Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau (HVCB) have created a new [video “Kuleana Campaign”](https://www.hawaii-aloha.com/blog/learn-to-live-aloha-kuleana-campaign-videos/){.external target="_blank"} to educate visitors about cultural norms and practices unique to the Aloha State. These unwritten rules are important to knowing what it means “Live Aloha” while enjoying a Hawaii vacation.
