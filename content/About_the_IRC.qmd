## The Daniel K. Inouye Regional Center

> "Located on a national historic landmark site on Oahu’s Ford Island, NOAA’s Inouye Regional Center features the adaptive reuse of two World War II-era airplane hangars linked by a new steel and glass building. The original hangars, designed in 1939 by Albert Kahn, inspired beautifully simple solutions for how the new Center uses air, water and light.
>
> The new complex accommodates 715 people in a high-performance research and office campus that integrates NOAA’s mission of “science, service and stewardship” with regional culture and ecology. It houses a diverse range of critical programs, functions and federal departments, including the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center."[^1]
